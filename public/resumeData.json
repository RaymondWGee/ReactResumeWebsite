I also clean and analyze datasets created from SQL queries as well as CSVs, by creating data visualizations by utilizing Pythong libraries (pandas, seaborn). In addition, I also utilize SQL to obtain metrics on our annotative data such as PCK (Percentage Correct Keypoints). All the while, I create Python scripts that allow users without much technical knowledge to run upload commands that would otherwise require the usage of devserver, SQL queries, and terminal commands. Lastly, I also do some excel sheet manipulation with basic regex in order to extract data."
