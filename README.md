- A little about me section to get to know me a bit more personally rather than just in a professional capacity. 
- Resume button functions like a download button for my resume, utilizing a shareable Google Drive link.

- And here is the section that represents my resume in a less...wordy and formal style. It lists out my education and relevent coursework, professional work experience, and a progress bar of skills and technologies that I feel are worth mentioning. There are a lot of other languages and technologies that I have dabbled with, such as Python and LAMP stack, but I felt that these were the ones more worth mentioning.

## Works Section

- This section links to the projects that I have worked on that are public. More to come!

## Quote Section

- Just a quote that I think about from time to time whenever I feel analysis paralysis. I want to say I came up with it, but it could honestly be a quote I read at some point in time so I will not claim that it is! The background is credited in the credits section.

## Email Contact Section

- This is a contact section which has four text input boxes and one button
  - Input Boxes: Name, Email, Subject, Message
  - Button: Submit 
- Once all the required information is filled out, you may click submit to send an email to Raymond
- On the right hand side, you can view what the current date and time is for me. The time updates with every second
- At the bottom, there is a upward facing arrow button that leads you back to the header at the top, along with links to my linkedin and github

## Credits
Based off of a React Template and worked from there to make personal modifications, removing and adding things as necessary or desired.
If you want to check out the original template, any of the background photos, or any of the packages/things I added that were not made by me, check out below!

##### Direct Resume Download Link
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lebCH3l6ePc">Instead of linking my resume to another path or website, I figured it would be more intuitive if it was just a download link, and I used this method to do that (the caveat here is that the file must be shareable by link from a Google Drive).</a>

##### React Loading Screen
<a href="https://github.com/nguyenbathanh/react-loading-screen">Used for loading screen (uses a lifecycle method rather than useEffect hooks)</a>

##### React Live Clock
<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-live-clock">Used to display my current timezone for contact purposes</a>

##### EmailJS
<a href="https://www.emailjs.com/">Used EmailJS to make contact section functional, without having to setup a backend</a>
