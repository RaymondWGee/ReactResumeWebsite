## Credits
Based off of a React Template and worked from there to make personal modifications, removing and adding things as necessary or desired.
If you want to check out the original template, any of the background photos, or any of the packages/things I added that were not made by me, check out below!

##### React Loading Screen
<a href="https://github.com/nguyenbathanh/react-loading-screen">Used for loading screen (uses a lifecycle method rather than useEffect hooks)</a>

##### React Live Clock
